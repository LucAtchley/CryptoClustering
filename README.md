# CryptoClustering

In this project, I used machine learning and Python to predict how cryptocurrency prices are affected in 24 hour to 7-day price changes. This project was accomplished by scaling the cryptocurrency data by using StandardScaling(). I then figured out the best value for k by creating an elbow curve based on the cryptocurreny scaled data. After figuring out k, I used K-Means to create a model and created clusters. I then did the same process with PCA, and compared the plots created.

The libraries I used in this project include scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and hvplot.

My main code and data can be found in the 'Stater_code' folder.
